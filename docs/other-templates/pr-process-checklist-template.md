## About Pull Request Checklist Template

Description:

Use this document in your repo to improve contribution quality. The following checklist template may be included with pull requests (PRs). This ensures people have thoroughly reviewed their code before the PR is submitted. This is an optional checklist and can be used as a file (e.g., .github/pull_request_template.md), comment in a PR, or elsewhere in the PR process. Link this information to your CONTRIBUTING.md, so contributors know they need to use this checklist. You can add this to your requirements for submitting a PR. Modify this template and its file name to meet your requirements.
