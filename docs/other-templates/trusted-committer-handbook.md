## About the trusted committer handbook

It is important to provide detailed expectations to your trusted committers (TCs). This handbook lays out expectations for the role that are specific to your project.

Document the scope of your TC role. Clear documentation sets expectations for new community members and establishes the role for future candidates. The following language can be used and expanded on. Replace generic words with the name of your project or product.

## The trusted committer role for the project

The trusted committer (TC) is a key role in this project’s community. We will trust you with important technical decisions and with mentoring contributors to ultimately get contributions over the finish line. This is a way for us to recognize and reward your valuable contributions and participation in the project. As a TC, you have earned the responsibility to push code closer to production and are allowed to perform tasks that have a higher level of risk associated with them.

As a TC, you represent the interests of both this projects InnerSource community and the product the ____ team is building. Our TCs are concerned with the health of both the community and the product. You have both tech- and community-oriented responsibilities.

## Time commitment

In this section, outline the time commitment you expect from a TC. Teams often create a schedule where TCs rotate. They are the TC for a sprint cycle and rotate. If you have maintainers that are also TCs, this means they have community engagement responsibilities during their scheduled rotation.

## Staying connected

As a TC, the project team wants to keep you informed.

- We will invite you to attend project team meetings: <list frequency/duration>
- We will add you to these project/product channels:  <list project/product channels>

As a new TC, we will sync with you weekly. This will decrease as needed over time. The purpose of these check-ins is to make sure you feel supported in your new role.

## How should TCs work with maintainers?

Describe how and when the TC should contact maintainers. How do you expect them to work together? What is the level of expected collaboration?

Why do we need trusted committers for this project?

- TCs allow our team to scale our ability to support a project and accept external contributions in a timely manner while maintaining a high quality standard.
- Many InnerSource projects will find themselves in a situation where they consistently receive feedback, features, and bug-fixes from contributors.  
- We want to create ways to increase the value that the project delivers.

## Sunsetting a trusted committer

A plan for removing access to project resources should be agreed upon by both parties, including transitioning their entry in a project’s Trusted Committer section to a list of past contributors.
