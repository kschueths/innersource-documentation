## About the contributor

In contrast to a traditional project, InnerSource projects come with the role of a Contributor. As a Contributor, you have the freedom to check out the source code of the component, make modifications to it and use the resulting improved version. A Contributor makes contributions to an InnerSource community. These contributions could be code or non-code artifacts, such as bug reports, feature requests, or documentation.

Contributors may or may not be part of the host team. They might be sent by another team to develop a feature the team needs. This is why we sometimes also refer to Contributors as Guests or as part of a Guest Team. The Contributor is responsible for "fitting in" and for conforming to the community’s expectations and processes.

## Benefits to sharing solutions

* Having more eyes with a more diverse background implies that code changes will be put under more scrutiny, leading to better overall quality and security.
* Reduces the cost of duplication.
* Enables your team to build something bigger than you alone could have accomplished alone.
* Becoming a Contributor can reduce the time for urgent bug fixes. It enables you to act yourself and support the host team with fixing that bug.
* Instead of waiting for features to be implemented or bugs fixed or working around issues, there is a third solution. Spend your time and energy to check back with the InnerSource project on what your needs are - and then make the change directly in the shared project. Clearly articulate your needs and come to a solution that works for both your team and the host team.

"But I could simply go and fork the project, make my changes there and save myself from all this coordination overhead!". Sure - forking the project is a way to get your job done. Except in the long run this means it’s on you to maintain that forked version for your team - and carry your changes forward for any new release the host team makes. Contributing your changes to the host team also means you get to benefit from their deeper knowledge of the component. They may spot issues in your patch that otherwise would only have become obvious in production.

A good Contributor can comfortably make a call for when it makes both technical and business sense to introduce a dependency and reuse a component instead of duplicating work. They can talk to management to explain the benefits of InnerSource contributions.

## Scope of InnerSource contributions

Is InnerSource only about source code? No! As an InnerSource Contributor, you can help the host team in multiple ways:

* Report issues you see when using the component.
* Create or fix test cases that show that the code isn’t working as expected.
* Improve documentation, so others spend less time using it and contributing to it.
* Support other users, help with bug triage.
* Improve builds.

No contribution is too small to contribute.

Every project that is run as an InnerSource project has the ultimate goal of expanding their development team beyond the original founders, tapping into the potential of further collaborators amongst users of that project.

## Individual motivations

* Fixing issues in projects they depend on for their daily work to reduce the number of workarounds in their own codebase.
* Instead of working in isolation, those working on the upstream project will be able review and improve your solution.
* You get support and mentoring which greatly speeds up your own development effort.
* Spending more time with others means that over time you will learn how the team works, how it organizes itself, which tooling it uses in which way to build their project. Oftentimes your own projects will benefit from that experience.
* Working on more than one core project means that you will be exposed to a larger ecosystem from which to draw best practices and solutions to challenges.
You get to influence projects. You influence directly via your own contributions and by sharing your experience and knowledge on project tooling and setup. This sharing helps the upstream project improve and accelerate development cycles.
* People find work on projects personally fulfilling and fun because they can self-select projects they want to work on. Self-selection also leads to host projects being very welcoming and supportive in their effort to keep contributors motivated.

## Team level motivation

Remember that annoying bug that’s been finally fixed upstream? Why should your team spend an extra effort to contribute that fix to the upstream project?

* Maintenance cost and time is now with the upstream project. For every new release it’s on them instead of on your team to make sure it keeps working with your modifications and requirements.
* Your team gets to have a say in the project direction and timelines, which can be beneficial for your team.
* Teams can establish a middle path between "be independent and build your own" (including any number of new bugs that you own)
* Teams can "save time and money by relying on existing implementations" (at the cost of creating long term dependencies which can only be influenced in a limited way).

## Company motivation

* It drives central innovation from the edges of your organization.
* InnerSource helps make projects central to the purpose of the business transparent and provides tools to put focus on mentoring and expanding the contributor base. This helps eliminate single points of failure.
* It enables learning and knowledge sharing within the organization.
* The impact of individuals will improve. Best practices and positive innovation will spread more easily across the entire organization.
* Improvements to the work environment will more easily spread across the organization - helping retain employees.
