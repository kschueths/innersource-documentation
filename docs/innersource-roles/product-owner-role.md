## About the product owner

The product owner is part of the host team. The host team, also known as a product team, are the primary decision-makers. They determine which contributions to accept or reject. They also provide guidance and mentorship to external contributors, ensuring the project’s alignment with its goals and maintaining its overall quality.

The product owner ensures that user stories representing the feature request are created, either by members of the guest team or host team. These stories should describe the requested feature in terms agreeable to the guest team. They also list any details from the host team on how the feature should be delivered for the contribution to be accepted.

The product owner defines the project's goals, priorities, and vision. They work with the original product team (host team) to ensure that contributions align with the project's objectives. Product owners often prioritize features or enhancements based on market demands and user needs.

On small, grass roots efforts a single person often fills both the product owner and trusted committer roles.

## Responsibilities

Some responsibilities may include:

* Selecting trusted committers
* Mentoring trusted committers to get them fully onboarded with the responsibilities of their role.
* Ongoing collaboration with the trusted committer to align feature priorities with contributions.
* Publishing planning documentation
* Writing contributing and getting started documentation.
* Marketing the project internally
* Finding collaboration opportunities by searching for redundancies at the company with similarities to your own project.

Open planning is important because it helps set expectations for other contributors around timelines and gives transparency into your project. Product managers should make sprint planning spreadsheets and roadmaps discoverable so that other teams can collaborate. This documentation will also help other teams locate redundancies that could reduce the amount of work your team will need to do. Making planning documentation transparent also allows leadership to get a clearer view of what is being worked on. This gives documented credit to the team for their work.

Some projects have more intricacies than other projects. It is the product owner’s responsibility to write documentation or ensure that documentation gets created by the team, such as the getting started processes and contributing guidelines. You can think of project documentation like a user manual for a house. Some houses have automatic hot water when you turn on a faucet and others may require turning more than one knob to make it work. Documenting these processes set your contributors up for success, making it easier for new contributors to contribute quality contributions on the first attempt. It may take more time on the front end to create this documentation, but it will save you time in the long run.

Marketing a project may include making sure that the reusable code is discoverable in the code catalog and promoting the project to the wider community. This is in collaboration with the trusted committer. The trusted committer fosters and mentors the community. The product owner promotes the product that the community contributes to. The product owner may create a blog post to tell the software community at the company about their project and how people can get involved. They can market their product by hosting coffee and a demo session for introducing projects in their early stages or present a lunch and learn or global brown bag for more established projects.

In the InnerSource framework, product owners should help reduce redundancies. They can search for other product owners working on similar tooling who could be good collaborators with their team. If three teams are working on something very similar or the same, the redundancy can be eliminated, and the workload spread out if the teams split the work between themselves. This elimination of redundancy can be communicated to upper management by showing monetary savings through time saved.
