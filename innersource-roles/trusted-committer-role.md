## About the trusted committer

The trusted committer is a key role in the InnerSource community. Trusted committers are people in a community that you trust with important technical decisions and with mentoring contributors to ultimately get contributions over the finish line.

Trusted committers represent the interests of both their InnerSource community and the products the host team is building. They are concerned with the health of both the community and the product. Trusted committers have both tech- and community-oriented responsibilities.

Compared to contributors, trusted committers have earned the responsibility to push code closer to production and are generally allowed to perform tasks that have a higher level of risk associated with them.

Trusted committers have various responsibilities, including:

* Ensuring product quality
* Keeping the community healthy
* Reducing the barriers to making contributions
* Up leveling the community
* Advocating the community’s needs

## Why the Role Name Matters

The role of the trusted committer is present in every successful InnerSource community but not every community uses that name. Some communities use the term Maintainer, but this term conflicts with other technical roles such as the "maintainer" role defined by GitHub, for instance. Apache uses the term Committer, too, but they attach fewer and mostly tech-oriented responsibilities to that role. With its additional community-oriented responsibilities, the Trusted Committer role goes beyond that. The "trusted" in trusted committer means this person is trusted and thus empowered by both their management and their community to do their job. By fostering openness and transparency, trusted committers build trust in the process and also in the product being built.

## Why do we need trusted committers?

* Many InnerSource projects will find themselves in a situation where they consistently receive feedback, features, and bug-fixes from contributors.
* Project maintainers want to find ways to scale their ability to support a project and accept external contributions in a timely manner while maintaining a high quality standard.
* Project maintainers want to find ways to lengthen the value delivered by a project.
* Project maintainers need to visibly reward frequent contributors and empower them to amplify their value contribution.
* They need a way to recognize and reward the work of the contributor above and beyond single contributions.
* There is a lack of mechanism and language for recognizing contributions across teams within an organization.

## Finding trusted committers

The following are a few guidelines for identifying a potential trusted committer:

* An active participant in community channels (Slack, JIRA issue triaging, etc.) becomes a Trusted Committer, thereby formalizing their role in community support.
* Someone who frequently submits code, documentation, or other repository changes.

Start by including this person on pull requests. If they are actively engaging in pull requests, consider approaching them about opportunities for further collaboration on the project.

The first step is to approach candidates about becoming a trusted committer. Maintainers should educate candidates on the role of a trusted committer. There is no expectation that candidates will accept the role of Trusted Committer. Each candidate should assess if they have the available bandwidth to take on the responsibilities.

When a candidate accepts the role, it is up to the project maintainers to publicly recognize the transition from user to trusted committer. It is also a good idea to add their name to a Trusted Committers section in your project’s CONTRIBUTING.md

## Define the trusted committer role for a project

What a trusted committer handles is up to each project and its maintainers. Ensure you document within the project the scope of your trusted committer role. Clear documentation sets expectations for new community members and establishes the role for future candidates.

## Maintaining trusted committer relationships

Once you formalize a new trusted committer, it is a good idea to keep them informed as you continue to iterate on your project. Keeping them in the loop can be as simple as inviting them to your project channel or as involved as including them in your planning sessions. More opportunities for involvement gives trusted committers a path to maintainer if they so desire. In some cases, a trusted committer may be an existing maintainer on a project who takes on the community responsibilities of a trusted committer.

Besides keeping trusted committers informed, it is good to check in on a regular basis. A suggested cadence is to start with every week before gradually progressing to every few weeks. The purpose of these check-ins is to make sure the trusted committer feels supported in their new role. Analogous to a 1:1 with your manager, if there are any issues, listen and empathize to try and understand what is preventing the Trusted Committer from being successful. Always thank the trusted committer for their continued effort in making the project successful and set a new date to check-in.

## Sunsetting a trusted committer

There are times which necessitate removing a trusted committer, such as if the trusted committer is:

* No longer willing to take part
* No longer able to perform their duties
* No longer employed by the company

A plan for removing access to project resources should be agreed upon by both parties, including transitioning their entry in a project’s trusted committer section to a list of past contributors.

Upon removing access, thank the trusted committer for their participation publicly. Public acknowledgment ensures clear communication of transition and continuity within the community.

## How does the trusted committer role impact other project users?

For contributors, achieving trusted committer status for a project demonstrates initiative in contributing to the community project. Recognition for these efforts can be used during annual reviews with managers.

For maintainers, as a project matures, maintainers can become less familiar with key aspects of a project. Trusted committers fill in these gaps, ensuring that all aspects of the project are better served over time.

A healthy set of trusted committers ensures that if project maintainers move on there is a plan for responsible stewardship.
