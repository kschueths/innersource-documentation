## About the CHANGELOG.md Template

Use this document in your repo to improve discoverability, reduce time creating new documents, and create a uniform style across projects.

Using a CHANGELOG.md template eliminates the time required to build a new skeleton template every time you create release notes. This is an optional template, but it's use will help standardize styling and information  provided.

Below is the InnerSource CHANGELOG.md template based on the Standard Release Process InnerSource pattern.
